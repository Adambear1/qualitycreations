    question: "Why not just make a website off Wix, Weeble, or WordPress?",
    answer:
      "Everything in life has its purpose. There are most definitely times such websites are preferred over custom, dynamic websites, and other times that are not. For simple landing pages, for personal resumes, one-time events (weddings, graduations, etc.), and other circumstantial occasions, using such websites might be best. However, for small businesses, organizations, and many other companies and individuals that fall prey to such websites, they might not be utilizing their resources in the best way. The fundamental difference between a WordPress site and a custom website is the dynamic ability a custom website can have. For instance, WordPress is static, confusing, and cannot process, withhold, or disburse valuable client information; hence, why it is more suitable for one-time-events and small occasions. With a custom website, the opportunities are endless. We have the ability to integrate top-technology into all platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, and Google authentication, metrics, and resources to further enhance websites. Thats not to mention that we have the ability to attach a database and algorithms to the code for the ability to create notifications, reports, and custom analytics, beneficial for future marketing of the company.
